2020-05-23  Version 0.1.2

	* README.cfg: An example of configuration file.

	Main script:

	* config: add defaults values for ConfigParser.
	Now, you just need to list selevctive variables in your configuration file,
	instead of all variables.

	Configuration file:

	error_real: renamed from error_type

2020-05-23  Version 0.1.1

	Configuration file:

	* New variable
	oneD_plot_sort: Plot sorted age data for 1D bar plot.


	Main script:

	* plot_oneD_weighted_mean: Modified for the new variable (oneD_plot_sort)


2020-05-22  Version 010

	Main script:

	Modified following functions for the new option of discordance (disc_type = 5).  

	* myEllipse: replace matplotlib.patches.Ellipse with plotting by numerical points

	* plot_2D_wm: Adjust for modification of myEllipse.

	Add new functions for the new option of discordance (disc_type = 5).

	* intersections_ellipse: Detect intersections between the error ellipse and concordia line.
	Shapely (Current version 1.7.0) is required for this function.

	* plot_data_point_error_ellipse_disc: plotting function for disc_type = 5.

	Configuration file:

	* New variable
	oneD_yaxis_log: use log scale for 1D bar plot.

	* New option
	disc_type: The fifth option for identifying discordant data.
	If we use disc_type = 5, the data points whose error ellipses do not intersect
	the concordia line are classified to discordant data.



2019-07-03  Version 009

	Main script:

	* Terra--Wasserburg concordia age: equations were modified

	* quickgui and Qt4Agg are now obsolete.  Options '-g' and '-n' were deleted.

	* Drivers Qt5Agg, TKAgg, and macosx can be selected by using option '-d'.
	PyQt5 should be installed, if Qt5Agg is used.

	* GESDtest: install a test for excluding outliers by using generalized ESD test

	* calc_chi2_red: reduced chi-squared test for check the data set represents a single population


	Configuration file:

	* New variables
	opt_outlier: apply generalized ESD rejection test (1) or not (0)
	outlier_alpha: significant level for GESD test


2019-03-05  Version 008

	Main script:

	* fix a bug related with calculation of MSWDconc, MSWDeq, MSWDcomb.

	Configuration file:

	* New variables
	dp0_bar_line_style, dp0_bar_line_width, dp0_bar_color
	dp1_bar_line_style, dp1_bar_line_width, dp1_bar_color
	dp2_bar_line_style, dp2_bar_line_width, dp2_bar_color

2019-01-24  Version 007

	Main script:

	* KDE plot: Use data only included in the range of graph.  Exclude data out of the range.

	Configuration file:

	* kde_multiplier: obsolete. Now automatically calculated.

	* opt_hist_density is a new option.  Histogram is shown by density of sample instead of number of sample

	* accept_data_points: deleted.

2018-09-12  Version 006

	Main script:

	* python3 is now default

	* calc_age_7Pb_6Pb: Calculate and output 7Pb/6Pb ages with errors

	* ConcAgeConv: Corrected equations for MSWDs and P-values

	* discordance: Added the fourth method of discordance

	Configuration file: new variables

	* accept_data_points is a new option

2017-10-30  Version 005

	Main script:

	* kde_multiplier: Corrected for a proper use of kde_multiplier

	* plotConcConv, plotConcTW: Specify markeredgecolor

	* plot_diagramse: Now ploting diagrams can be selected.

	Configuration file: new variables

	* plot_diagrams: Choose diagrams to be plotted


2017-04-17  Version 004

	Main script:

	* calc_age_7Pb_6Pb: 207Pb/206Pb ages with errors can be calculated

	* ConcAgeConv, ConcAgeTW: Output probability of concordia ages as
	P(chi^2) with MSWDs

	* myEllipse: Show a warning message, if error ellipses could not
	be drawn.  This may be mainly caused by inappropriate correlation
	coefficient between X and Y (rho_xy or rho_XY).


	Configuration file: new variables

	* digits_number_output: Set number of decimal digits (significant
	figures)

	* ca_mswd: Select one of MSWDs for concordia ages, which include
	concordance (0), equivalence (1), and combined of them (2).


2016-11-15  Version 003

	Main script:

	* Outputs have now two significant figures

	* Remove assumption of Th/U errors (10%), if they are not given.

	* Use equation (2a) in York (2004, Am. J. Phys., vol. 72,
	p. 367-375) for uncertainties of regression lines to simplify the
	equation


2016-09-26  Version 002

	Main script:

	* Add comments for Python3 users

	* Modify algorithm of calculations of regression lines
